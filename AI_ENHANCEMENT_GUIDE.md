- Status distributions and changes
- Priority levels and assignments
- Update frequencies and patterns

### **Team-Level Data**
- Workload distribution across team members
- Individual productivity patterns
- Collaboration indicators
- Task completion rates

### **Project-Level Data**
- Cross-project dependencies
- Resource allocation patterns
- Timeline adherence
- Bottleneck identification

## üéØ **Sample AI Analysis Output**

Based on your E5GC project data, AI analysis might provide:

### **Executive Summary**
> "The E5GC team shows strong momentum with 46% of tasks completed and active progress on critical infrastructure components. Team workload is well-distributed across 6 contributors, with focus areas in deployment automation and power management optimization."

### **Key Insights**
- **High completion rate**: 6 out of 13 tasks completed (46%) indicates strong execution
- **Balanced workload**: Tasks distributed fairly across team members (2-3 tasks each)
- **Infrastructure focus**: Multiple deployment and configuration tasks suggest infrastructure maturation phase
- **Technical depth**: Tasks span BIOS settings, networking, and automation indicating comprehensive approach

### **Recommendations**
1. **Standardize priority assignment**: 12 tasks marked "Undefined" priority - implement priority guidelines
2. **Documentation focus**: Consider creating knowledge base for completed infrastructure work
3. **Cross-training opportunities**: Team members working on different technical areas could share knowledge
4. **Automation opportunities**: Multiple manual configuration tasks could benefit from automation scripts

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Options**

You can customize AI enhancement in your `config.json`:

```json
{
  "ai_enhancement": {
    "enabled": true,
    "cursor_integration": true,
    "gemini_selenium": false
  }

# Must be logged into Gemini in browser
```

## üí° **Usage Tips**

### **Best Practices**
1. **Review AI insights** before including in official reports
2. **Combine with domain knowledge** - AI provides data patterns, you provide context
3. **Use as starting points** for deeper analysis and discussion
4. **Customize prompts** in the generated files for specific focus areas

### **Common Use Cases**
